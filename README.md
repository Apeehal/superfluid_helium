# superfluid_helium
This is a 2D simulation of superfluid helium flowing down a pipe, which handles both the fluid flow and heat transfer.
The main source for the equations that are being solved can be found here:

For now the simulation is only in the Landau regime, but in the future it would be interesting to add turbulence and Kapitza resistance.
